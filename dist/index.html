        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          I was first introduced to coding through a mobile game called 'Graal'
          where I would write HTML tags and CSS properties into my bio so it
          would look cooler than everyone else's. I learned it by googling how
          other players would do it but never tried to use those codes outside
          of the game. A few years later I practiced coding during the beginning
          of the pandemic when I found out that Harvard had free online software
          development classes. However, it wasn't until I enrolled into NJIT's
          software development program that I started taking coding
          seriously.<span id="dots">..</span
          ><span id="more">
            The courses really pushed me to my limits and taught me a lot about
            myself as well as a multitude of languages, frameworks, databases
            and architectural designs of websites. I am currently learning how
            to become more skilled in react and SASS. Outside of frontend
            development I enjoy playing my instruments and producing music,
            trying new restaurants and skateboarding. I strive towards bettering
            my skills everyday so that I can make an impact in me and my
            family's lives. Hope you enjoyed my portfolio! Have a blessed day.
