        <h2>About</h2>
        <h4>I was first introduced to coding through a video game called 
          'Graal' where I would write HTML tags and CSS properties into my bio so 
          it would look cooler than everyone else's. I learned it by googling how other players 
          would do it but never tried to use those codes outside of the game.  
          A few years later I practiced coding during the beginning of the pandemic when I found out 
          that Harvard had free online software development classes.  </h4>
